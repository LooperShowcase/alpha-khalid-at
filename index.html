    <p>
      Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993,
       by Jensen Huang (CEO as of 2022),
        a Taiwanese-American, previously director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at 
        Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chris Malachowsky, an electrical engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems,
         and Curtis Priem, previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at Sun Microsystems.
      In 1993, the three co-founders believed that the proper 
      direction for the next wave of computing was accelerated or graphics-based 
      computing because it could solve problems that general-purpose computing could not. 
      They also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging 
      problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Video games became the company's flywheel to reach 
      large markets and funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems. With only $40,000 in the bank,
       the company was born.[25] The company subsequently received $20 million of venture capital funding from 
       Sequoia Capital and others.[26] Nvidia initially had no name and the co-founders named all their files NV,
        as in "next version". The need to incorporate the company prompted the co-founders to review all words
         with those two letters, leading them to "invidia", the Latin word for "envy".[25] Nvidia went public on January
          22, 1999.[27][28][29]
